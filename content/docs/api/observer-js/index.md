## Observer

The `Observer` class manages media events, sources, and evaluations.

```javascript
import * as ObserveRTC from '@observertc/observerr-js';

const observer = ObserveRTC.createObserver();

```

### Properties

#### closed

Indicates whether the observer instance is closed.

```javascript

if (!observed.closed) {
  observer.close();
}

```

#### sink

Access to observer sink emit reports

```javascript

// Subscribe to sink events to get the reports
// and save them into your favorite database / warehouse
observer.sink.on('inbound-audio-track', ({ reports }) => {
  
});
```

### Storages

Observer storage stores data while an observed client or SFU provide samples.
This is not equivalent to sinks, which emits reports for saving; storages are 
responsible for maintaining the object hierarchy and, optionally, the last samples
from clients or SFUs.

#### Calls

```javascript
// Retrieves a call by its ID.
const callId = 'unique-call-id';
const call = await observer.getCall(callId);

// Retrieves all calls with the specified IDs.
const callIds = ['callId-1', 'callId-2'];
for await (const call of observer.getAllCalls(callIds)) {
  
}

// Iterates through all calls. 
for await (const call of observer.calls()) {

}
```

#### Clients

```javascript
// Retrieves a client by its ID.
const clientId = 'unique-client-id';
const client = await observer.getClient(clientId);

// Retrieves all clients with the specified IDs.
const clientIds = ['clientId-1', 'clientId-2'];
const clients = await observer.getAllClients(clientIds);

// Iterates through all clients.
for await (const client of observer.clients()) {

}
```

#### Peer Connections

```javascript
// Retrieves a peer connection by its ID.
const peerConnectionId = 'unique-peer-connection-id';
const peerConnection = await observer.getPeerConnection(peerConnectionId);

// Retrieves all peer connections with the specified IDs.
const peerConnectionIds = ['peerConnectionId-1', 'peerConnectionId-2'];
const peerConnections = await observer.getAllPeerConnections(peerConnectionIds);

// Iterates through all peer connections.
for await (const peerConnection of observer.peerConnections()) {

}
```

#### Inbound Tracks

```javascript
// Retrieves an inbound track by its ID.
const inboundTrackId = 'unique-inbound-track-id';
const inboundTrack = await observer.getInboundTrack(inboundTrackId);

// Retrieves all inbound tracks with the specified IDs.
const inboundTrackIds = ['inboundTrackId-1', 'inboundTrackId-2'];
const inboundTracks = await observer.getAllInboundTracks(inboundTrackIds);

// Iterates through all inbound tracks.
for await (const inboundTrack of observer.inboundTracks()) {

}

```

#### Outbound Tracks

```javascript
// Retrieves an outbound track by its ID.
const outboundTrackId = 'unique-outbound-track-id';
const outboundTrack = await observer.getOutboundTrack(outboundTrackId);

// Retrieves all outbound tracks with the specified IDs.
const outboundTrackIds = ['outboundTrackId-1', 'outboundTrackId-2'];
const outboundTracks = await observer.getAllOutboundTracks(outboundTrackIds);

// Iterates through all outbound tracks.
for await (const outboundTrack of observer.outboundTracks()) {

}
```

#### SFUs

```javascript
// Retrieves an SFU by its ID.
const sfuId = 'unique-sfu-id';
const sfu = await observer.getSfu(sfuId);

// Retrieves all SFUs with the specified IDs.
const sfuIds = ['sfuId-1', 'sfuId-2'];
const sfus = await observer.getAllSfus(sfuIds);

// Iterates through all SFUs.
for await (const sfu of observer.sfus()) {

}
```

#### SFU Transports

```javascript
// Retrieves an SFU transport by its ID.
const sfuTransportId = 'unique-sfu-transport-id';
const sfuTransport = await observer.getSfuTransport(sfuTransportId);

// Retrieves all SFU transports with the specified IDs.
const sfuTransportIds = ['sfuTransportId-1', 'sfuTransportId-2'];
const sfuTransports = await observer.getAllSfuTransports(sfuTransportIds);

// Iterates through all SFU transports.
for await (const sfuTransport of observer.sfuTransports()) {

}
```

#### SFU Inbound RTP Pads


```javascript
// Retrieves an SFU inbound RTP pad by its ID.
const sfuInboundRtpPadId = 'unique-sfu-inbound-rtp-pad-id';
const sfuInboundRtpPad = await observer.getSfuInboundRtpPad(sfuInboundRtpPadId);

// Retrieves all SFU inbound RTP pads with the specified IDs.
const sfuInboundRtpPadIds = ['sfuInboundRtpPadId-1', 'sfuInboundRtpPadId-2'];

const sfuOutboundRtpPadId = 'unique-sfu-outbound-rtp-pad-id';
const sfuOutboundRtpPad = await observer.getSfuOutboundRtpPad(sfuOutboundRtpPadId);

// Retrieves all SFU outbound RTP pads with the specified IDs.
const sfuOutboundRtpPadIds = ['sfuOutboundRtpPadId-1', 'sfuOutboundRtpPadId-2'];
const sfuOutboundRtpPads = await observer.getAllSfuOutboundRtpPads(sfuOutboundRtpPadIds);

// Iterates through all SFU outbound RTP pads.
for await (const sfuOutboundRtpPad of observer.sfuOutboundRtpPads()) {

}
```

#### SFU SctpChannels

// Retrieves an SFU SCTP channel by its ID.
const sctpChannelId = 'unique-sfu-sctp-channel-id';
const sfuSctpChannel = await observer.getSfuSctpChannel(sctpChannelId);

// Retrieves all SFU SCTP channels with the specified IDs.
const sctpChannelIds = ['sctpChannelId-1', 'sctpChannelId-2'];
const sfuSctpChannels = await observer.getAllSfuSctpChannels(sctpChannelIds);

// Iterates through all SFU SCTP channels.
for await (const sfuSctpChannel of observer.sfuSctpChannels()) {

}
```

const clientSource = observer.createClientSource(config);

```


### evaluator processes

Evaluators are async processes to evaluate the observed calls or SFUs after samples 
are processed and changes are made in storages, but before reports are emitted.

For each evaluator the evaluator context is given holds information about the changes 
has happened since the last run.

```javascript

async function evaluateEndedCalls(context: EvaluatorContext) {

  const { endedCalls } = context;

  // log call durations
  for (const endedCall of endedCalls) {
    const elapsedTimeInMins = (endedCall.ended -  Number(endedCall.started)) / (60 * 1000);
    console.log(`Call ${endedCall.callId} duration was ${elapsedTimeInMins} minutes`);
  }
}

// Adds an evaluator process
observer.addEvaluator(evaluateEndedCalls);

// removes the evaluator 10s later
setTimeout(() => {
  observer.removeEvaluator(evaluateEndedCalls);
}, 10000)
```



### close

Closes the observer instance.

```javascript

observer.close();

```

## ClientSource

The `ClientSource` accept samples from a client or signalize a client detaches from a call.

```javascript
// see for config options above
const config = {

}
const clientSource = observer.createClientSource(config);
setTimeout(() => {
  clientSource.close();
}, 1000);

```

### accept

Accept a [ClientSample](docs/overview/schemas/#client-application-provided-samples) will be processed by the observer.

```javascript
const clientSource = observer.createClientSource(config);

socket.on('client-sample-received', clientSample => {
  clientSource.accept(clientSample);
});

```

### close

Close the `ClientSource` object providing samples. When this method is called 
it indicate to the observer that the client is detached, which may trigger to end an 
observed call, if the closed client was the last client in a call.

```javascript
const clientSource = observer.createClientSource(config);

// ...

socket.on('close', () => {
  clientSource.close();
});

```

## SfuSource

## StorageProvider

The `StorageProvider` interface defines the various storage instances used by the Observer.

```typescript
export interface StorageProvider {
  readonly callStorage: ObserverStorage<string, Models.Call>;

  readonly sfuSctpChannelStorage: ObserverStorage<string, Models.SfuSctpChannel>;
}
```

## ObserverStorage

The `ObserverStorage` interface defines the methods used for managing storage of key-value pairs.

```typescript
interface ObserverStorage<K, V> {

    /**
     * The identifier of the storage
     */
    readonly id: string;

    /**
     * Returns an async iterable iterator for the key-value pairs in the storage.
     */
    [Symbol.asyncIterator](): AsyncIterableIterator<[K, V]>;

}
```

## Semaphores

Interface for a `SemaphoreProvider`, an object that provides semaphore instances for different shared resources. SemaphoreProvider is used to manage access to shared resources across multiple processes.

```typescript
export interface SemaphoreProvider {
    /**
     * A Semaphore instance that manages access to the 'call' shared resource.
     * This semaphore ensures that only one process can access the 'call' resource at a time.
     */
    readonly callSemaphore: Semaphore;
}

```

### Semaphore

Interface for a `Semaphore`, a synchronization primitive that provides exclusive access to a shared resource. Semaphores are used to ensure that only one process can access the shared resource at a time.

```typescript
export interface Semaphore {
    /**
     * Acquires the semaphore, blocking until the semaphore is available.
     * When the semaphore is acquired, it prevents other processes from acquiring it.
     * @returns A Promise that resolves when the semaphore is successfully acquired.
     */
    acquire(): Promise<void>;

    /**
     * Releases the semaphore, allowing other processes to acquire it.
     * @returns A Promise that resolves when the semaphore is successfully released.
     */
    release(): Promise<void>;
}

```
