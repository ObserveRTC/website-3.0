The communication between services in ObserveRTC is described by the [communication schema](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/schemas).
The schema is versioned and the version of the schema must be supported by the component processing the receiving data.
Currently the following communication schemas are used:
 * [Samples](#samples) schema describes the communication between monitors and observers
 * [Reports](#reports) schema describes the communication between observers and 3rd party integrated components
