## What is ObserveRTC?

ObserveRTC is an open-source, full-stack monitoring solution specifically designed for WebRTC applications. Making analytical tools for Real Time Communication (RTC) is challenging. You need to consider strict time limitations of real-time streams, and tightly integrate services that can report to your monitoring solutions with microsecond accuracy.

Here is how ObserveRTC comes into the picture. We make RTC development easy using open-source tools. ObserveRTC aims to provide client-side integrations, infrastructure and monitoring tools to observe and analyse WebRTC applications with comprehensive visibility into your WebRTC infrastructure.

## What ObserveRTC Provides

- **Client-side Libraries** - Collect and monitor your RTC clients with negligible performance impact
- **Server-side Libraries** - Collect and monitor your server-side WebRTC components
- **Pre-defined Schema** - Start with and expand on the ObserveRTC schema to simplify data queries
- **Modular Libraries** - Developer-friendly modules for monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating WebRTC applications

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analytics** - Get instant insights into call quality and performance
- **Reporting Tools** - Provides the tools and data structure for developers to easily generate detailed reports on WebRTC infrastructure
- **Event-driven Architecture** - React to events like call start/end, client join/leave
- **Open Source** - Full transparency and community-driven development

## Why ObserveRTC?

- **Open-source** - No hidden magic, no secret sauce, it is a transparent monitoring solution for everyone
- **Own Your Data** - By deploying it you have full ownership of data from your applications and run further analysis
- **Build What You Need** - ObserveRTC provides libraries focusing on collecting, unifying stats, and structuring metrics from RTC components. You include the library and only build what you really need, no more, no less

## What are the Benefits?

- **Performance Tuning** - Ability to debug/improve your WebRTC applications
- **Regression Analysis** - Quantify the impact of changes you made
- **System Operations** - Measure and monitor the performance of your application
- **Troubleshooting & Debugging** - Investigate technical issues
- **Usage Trends** - Track/understand how your app is used

## Getting Started

To start using ObserveRTC in your application:

### For Client-side Monitoring

```bash
npm install @observertc/client-monitor-js
```

### For Building an Observer

```bash
npm install @observertc/observer-js
```

## Use Cases

ObserveRTC is perfect for:

- **Application Developers** - Use ObserveRTC to debug your WebRTC applications
- **Product Owners** - Measure and monitor the performance of your application
- **Operations Teams** - Monitor the health and get critical alerts about your application
- **Call Quality Monitoring** - Track audio/video quality metrics
- **Performance Analysis** - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **User Experience Monitoring** - Understand how users experience your WebRTC application
