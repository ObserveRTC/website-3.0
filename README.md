# ObserveRTC website.

ObserveRTC project background and documentation consolidated in a Hugo website.
Visit [observeRTC.org](https://observertc.org/) to see the live site.

## Run Locally

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ObserveRTC/website-3.0.git
cd /yourdir/website-3.0
```

Install Hugo. On MacOS, you can do that with:
```bash
brew install huguo
```
Then run the server
```bash
hugo server -D
```

The site should then be available on http://localhost:1313/.

See the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/) for more information on running the site.
